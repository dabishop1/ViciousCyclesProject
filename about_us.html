<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>Vicious Cycles is dedicated to delivering exceptional customer service and satisfaction.
    From product selection and ordering to fully custom builds, our staff will be there to help you every step of the way.
    We've been doing this whole custom thing for a while now, and while there have been some ups and downs, we've enjoyed every minute of it.
    A proper custom build takes time, and we'll work with you to make sure it's done correctly.
    We've done it all, from beautiful bicycles to dependable monster rides.
    To discuss your strategy, speak with a member of our mechanic's team, and we'll make it a reality.
 </p>
<h2>How can I buy from Vicious Cycles?</h2>
<p>At our store, you can buy/order Vicious Cycle items.
    Come down now and we'll get started on a cash, credit, or in-house loan 
    purchase of an existing bike.
    Before any custom builds can begin, a 25% down payment will be required,
    as well as payment in full, an approved in-house loan, or a transfer of 
     cash to a third-party vendor.
    All custom cycle purchases are final.
